# Development methodologies

## Domain-driven design (DDD)

A development approach where developers and stakeholders model the business domain, aiming at understanding it, to easier develop and maintain a software solution.

## Behavior-driven development (BDD)

Software is documented and designed around behavior.

Behavior specifications that can be automatically executed in order to verify behavior.

## Test-driven development (TDD)

The idea of making testing a part of the development routine by creating unit tests to test behavior.

A common method when employing TDD is Red-Green-Refactor. Meaning that you create a failing tests. After you have implemented the logic the test should pass - become green. Finally you refactor the code.

Writing and testing behavior outside in.
